# FPGA-Accelerated Embedded Neural Network -- MNIST
- Classifies handwritten numbers in real-time
- VGA and USB mouse GUI

## How to run the program:
- Once the binary is uploaded to the FPGA, run the software program in Eclipse
- Wait for USB mouse to connect (may need to touch the MAX3421E chip)
- Once connected, the mouse acts as a pointer for the paint canvas that appears on the monitor
- Draw a number and watch as the probabilities change in real-time
- To clear the canvas, press the restart button (KEY 0)
